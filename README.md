# Paper Snowflake Designer

## What is it?

This demo project uses HTML canvas to draw symmetric, six-pointed snowflakes. You can use it to predict how a design will appear when cut out of paper, or just draw intricate designs that are nice to look at but aren't practical to cut.

I'm not a Javascript pro, so the code isn't pro either :)

Impractical to cut, but neat-looking:

Some snippets of the Javascript are from various sites and HTML canvas tutorials.
